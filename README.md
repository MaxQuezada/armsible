# armsible/bin

A collection of scripts to be used in conjunction with Armsible roles.

The current crop is entirely
[Ansible dynamic inventory sources](http://docs.ansible.com/intro_dynamic_inventory.html),
but additional types of scripts may be included in future.

## Requirements

A `requirements.txt` file is provided as an exhaustive dependency set
for all scripts within this project. This currently entails
`local_network_inventory.py`'s dependency on `python-nmap`.
